The visualization was inspired by a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/07/29/upshot/olympics-medal-table-paris.html" rel="nofollow">New York Times</a> piece in which they identified that most of the schemes for ranking Olympic teams by the number of gold, silver, and bronze medals are actually just points in a 2D space, where one dimension is the value of silver with respect to gold, and the other is the value of bronze with respect to silver.',o,n,t="This accounts for all points-based schemes - you can come up with weirder schemes like points = gold^3 + silver^2 + bronze, but most schemes fall somewhere on this 2D plane.
