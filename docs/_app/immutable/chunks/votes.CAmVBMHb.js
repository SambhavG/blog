For this we look at Nate Silver’s polling estimations, which show Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, North Carolina, Wisconsin, Arizona, and Nevada with a less than 4 margin either way (this cutoff is arbitrary and you could run this experiment with all 50 states if you wanted). Virginia has some weird and few recent polls, but we will mark it solid D to keep things simple. We also ignore the split votes in Nebraska and Maine. <a href="https://www.270towin.com/maps/kyvld" rel="nofollow">This is our map</a>.</li> <li>Sample an election outcome. Assume all states are independent, so the chance of national polling bias is not higher than any other arrangement of polling biases among the swing states. To sample an election, we sample an outcome for each state. To sample a state, we find Nate Silver’s estimated poll numbers, the average number of people in each poll used (turned out to be ~800 except for Pennsylvania, which had larger polls), and the number of people who voted in 2020 for each state (pulled from <a href="https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/number-of-voters-and-voter-registration-in-thousands-as-a-share-of-the-voter-population" rel="nofollow">here</a> for November 2020). Several aspects of this are rather imprecise, but this whole experiment is very hand-rolled in terms of statistics so I’m not very concerned. This is just for fun.</li> <li>If there is a tipping state, observe what range of outcomes in that state would make it a tipping state. For example, anywhere between +.0001 and +3% for the winning party, if the next closest state for the winning party was won by 3%. A tipping state for the winning party would usually be a tipping state for the losing party too (though I’ll roughly ignore deadlock scenarios), so this would turn into some margin like -2% to 3%.</li> <li>Compute the probability that this state will be won by 1 vote for the winning party (constant for all states), but divide that by the probability that the outcome will be between -2% and +3%. In other words, we don’t care about the outcomes where the state is outside that range because it wouldn’t have been a tipping state in the first place. Actually, sometimes a small state like Nevada can swap with a big state and the big state will still be the tipping state; the way we check in practice sweeps the state across the spread until it would be a tipping state on either side to find the boundaries.</li> <li>Run steps 2-4 for a couple thousand trials (I did 30,000, but my code was pretty slow).</li> <li>Take an average of all the tipping vote probabilities for every time each state was a tipping state; multiply that by the probability that the state was a tipping state to get relative numbers for each state.
